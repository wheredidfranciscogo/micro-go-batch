# micro-go-batch

In this project I'm going to simulate the assembly of robots using a series of classes and functions. The idea is to implement a micro-batching system where individual tasks (represented as components needed to assemble a robot) are grouped together and processed in batches. Upon completion of each batch, a special number is assigned to the assembled robot.

This time I'll be attempting to complete this functionality using Golang.
